## Overview

In the following Chapter, we detail the data submission part which happens after the acceptance / publication phase. 

Not everybody needs to send their data to CDS! We invite you to read carefully the next sections to understand your next steps.

## Where to deposit the data?

Two routes are possible to submit your data to VizieR:

- Option 1: If not too bulky, use the submission [**online interface**][vizier-submit-login]
	- The upload will generate a *ReadMe* skeleton file based on your tables and perform a few basic checks.
		- You will need to check and complete this *ReadMe* file. 
		- Alternatively, if you already have created a *ReadMe* file, you can upload it directly along with your tables.
	- In addition to your table, FITS files (spectra or images) for associated data can be uploaded
		- They will be then available via our [dedicated interface Saada/VizieR][vizier-assoc-data].
- Option 2: Use the [**File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**][vizier-ftp-login]
	- You can use the [**Python cdspyreadme library**][vizier-cdspyreadme] to create the required *ReadMe* file.
	- Tables and other data (not necessarily FITS) can be uploaded. More information on the data types accepted are available in the previous Chapter <a href="section_prepare_data.html" target="_blank">Preparing your data</a>.


<!-- #### Special case: large volumetry -->
The submission web application is an HTTP service and depends of authors network. The process is dedicated for tables size less than 100Mb but accepts tables until ~200Mb. 


<!-- Contact CDS -->
For larger files or any other questions, please contact the VizieR staff: [cats(at)cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr](mailto:cats@cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr).

## ReadMe file

<!-- Source: https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/vizier/submit.htx  // Section 3 -->
### The why and what of the ReadMe file

To be reusable, any data needs extra information. In astronomy, the convention is to give this information (authors, title, references, summary, etc...) in a separate file called *ReadMe*. 

Every catalogue in the Virtual Observatory registry has its own *ReadMe*.
Numerous examples can be found on the [FTP directories][vizier-ftp-cats] at CDS.
A typical illustration could be e.g. [J/A+A/382/389/ReadMe][vizier-readme-example].

### How to generate the ReadMe file?

There are two recommended ways to generate your own *ReadMe* file: 

- With the submission [**online interface**][vizier-submit-login]:
	- The upload table process generates a *ReadMe* skeleton and the standardized tables; both are required for VizieR.
	- This *ReadMe* file can then be edited or you can upload your own file.
- With the [cdspydreadme][vizier-cdspyreadme] Python library:
	- This package builds *ReadMe*, standardized tables (in ASCII aligned format) or MRT tables from tables which can be in different formats (`CSV`, `votable`, `FITS`, `astropy.Tables`, or `MRT` formats).
	- The whole *ReadMe* can then be tested with the command line tool [anafile][anafile]. 

![Figure: ReadMe Generator Python library Github page (screenshot)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cds-astro/a-FAIR-journey-for-astronomical-data/main/episodes/images/vizier_cdspyreadme.png){alt="Screenshot: ReadMe Generator Python library Github page, from July 2023"}

<!--  ----------------------------------------- -->
### How to fill the ReadMe file

The [Standards for Astronomical Catalogues][vizier-readme-std] gives a complete description of the standard for *ReadMe* files. 

In the following we give some tips on how to fill three different sections of the *ReadMe* file properly.
The rest of the *ReadMe* will be filled by CDS, and thus does not appear below. 



<!-- Details of the template -->
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### The ReadMe file in more depth

General comment: no line in this description file can exceed 80 characters!

It is moreover suggested to limit the textual parts to 70 characters, such that a conversion to FITS could keep the text as COMMENT cards.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


<!-- ---------------- -->
:::::::::::::::: solution
#### A. 'Abstract' and 'Description' headers

- **Abstract**: Describes the *scientific results* that the author(s) derived from the data. 
	- It is simply the one from your refereed paper. 
- **Description**: Gives the *context of the data*, such as instrumentation or observing conditions. 
	- It should answer the following questions: *what*, *where*, *when*, *how*.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::


<!-- ---------------- -->
:::::::::::::::: solution
#### B. 'Objects' header (optional)
The list of **observed objects** can be used when no data table contains the list and position of the astronomical objects observed or studied, as for example in the study of a high-resolution spectrum of a single star. Such a list is normally restricted to very few objects â€“ less than 10 or 20 typically.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::


<!-- ---------------- -->
:::::::::::::::: solution
#### C. 'Byte-by-byte Description of file' header

This section describes the structure of each data files (files with the .dat extension).
This description is made in a tabular form, each row describing one field (column) of the data file.

The description is presented as a five-column table with the following elements:

- the *starting* (from 1) and *ending* byte of column, separated by a dash -; this dash is however not required for a single-byte column.
- the *format* of the field, written as a *fortran-like* format
    + **A***n*      for a character column made of *n* characters;
    + **I***n*      for a column containing an integer number of *n* digits;
    + **F***n.d*    for a column containing a float number of width *n* digits and up to *d* digits in the fractional part;
    + **E***n.d*    for a number using the exponential notation;
- the [units][vizier-cat-32-units] used in the field. **SI** units are strongly encouraged, avoid the CGS units (for instance, use **mW/m2** instead of **ergs/s/cm2**).
- the *label* (heading) of the field, made of a single word (*no embedded blank*); a few [basic conventions][vizier-cat-33-labels] are used for usual parameters (e.g. positions) and related quantities (e.g. mean errors).
- a short *explanations* of the contents of the column. 
This last field may also specify: the available range of the value in the column (using **[...]**), the possibility of having unspecified or NULL values (using **?**), the order of the values within the table (increasing or decreasing order). More details can be found [here][vizier-cat-34-explanations].

The CDS can help you to fill that part of the headers, but you will be responsible for the *explanations* and the *units*.

<!-- 		Step-by-step: submission form	-->
<!--  ----------------------------------------- -->
<!-- https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/vizier.submit/help.html -->
## Data submission (option 1): Online interface

The first option is to use the online interface available at: [https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/vizier.submit/][vizier-submit-login].

This web application enables the upload of the data and invites you to fill a *ReadMe* file generated by the application.
The VizieR upload application will create a **TEMPORARY** repository containing your tables, associated files (spectra, images, cubes) if any, and the *ReadMe* file.

**However, even after completing all steps, your catalogue will not be readily available in VizieR. Additional work by the VizieR team is needed, including checks and homogenization to our standards, before the catalogue is fully ingested.**

In the following, we show how to upload your data step-by-step. Additional information on how to use this service can be found on the [VizieR catalogue upload (HELP) page][vizier-submit-data-help].


-------

### Start a session

No account creation is needed. One just needs to choose a login for the session, eg. *my_unique_id_2023*.
The login can be reused until the completion of the process but not after submission.

**Note - 1:** Your login is tight to a given IP address.

**Note - 2:** Please contact the VizieR staff: [cats(at)cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr](mailto:cats@cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr) if a modification to a recently submitted upload is needed.

-------

### Upload tables

The VizieR submit service detects automatically the input format.
Please, upload here only the regular tabular data (tables).
More information on the accepted formats can be found in the Chapter [Preparing your data](../section_prepare_data.md).


The upload will generate:

- a *ReadMe* skeleton including the byte-by-byte based on your uploaded tables
- ASCII tables with aligned columns (FORTRAN Format / MRT (Machine Readable Table))


**Note:** Check that all the tables are uploaded at this stage. Adding tables later implies to remove all tables and *ReadMe*.


![Figure: VizieR catalogue upload page - step Tables (screenshot)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cds-astro/a-FAIR-journey-for-astronomical-data/main/episodes/images/vizier_submit_online_interface_july23/step1_tables.png){alt="Screenshot: VizieR Catalogue upload page, start uploading Tables after initiating a session, from June 2023"} 



-------

### Fill the ReadMe

Once the tables uploaded, the next step is to fill the *ReadMe* file. You can:

- Edit online
- Download and complete locally
- Upload your own *ReadMe* 


Then you submit the updated *ReadMe* with the "upload" button:

- This action will check the consistency between the *ReadMe* and your files. 
- The page is refreshed and a report is displayed. This output is the result of the anafile package - see next section.
- **In case of error, the CDS recommends to review the ReadMe (and remove the ReadMe).**
- But, even if you encountered problems, you can still go to the next step.


**Note - 1:** The online mode makes regular backups. You can restore the last version and force the backup.

**Note - 2:** Check that all the tables are uploaded at this stage. Adding tables later implies to remove all tables and *ReadMe*.


![Figure: VizieR catalogue upload page - step Readme (screenshot)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cds-astro/a-FAIR-journey-for-astronomical-data/main/episodes/images/vizier_submit_online_interface_july23/step2_readme.png){alt="Screenshot: VizieR Catalogue upload page, fill the ReadMe file after initiating a session and uploading your tables, from June 2023"} 



-------

### Upload FITS Spectra / Time series

Once the tables and the *ReadMe* are uploaded, you can upload your associated data: spectra and time series.
More information on the accepted formats can be found in the Chapter [Preparing your data](../section_prepare_data.md).

The FITS upload generates a mapping between the spectra FITS header and ObsCore keywords. We strongly encourage you to modify the mapping to better describe your data.

**Note: Although multiple formats are accepted, only FITS files will be indexed and accessible through the [VizieR associated data service][vizier-assoc-data] and through the Virtual Observatory**. 
The other formats will still be accessible through the FTP. 

The uploaded files can be of the following:

- a single FITS file (possibly compressed)
- a collection of independent FITS files gathered into an archive (.tar)
	- Independent means that headers are not similar and each FITS needs a dedicated mapping
- a collection of similar FITS files gathered into an archive (.tar)
	- In that case, we make a unique mapping to describe all resources in the archive (.tar). Be careful, this option is available only if FITS have similar headers.

For each upload, a report is available. **It is recommended to verify the mapping by clicking on the report header.**

-------

### Upload FITS images

FITS images can also be uploaded in a similar way as the FITS Spectra (see above).
 
More information on the accepted formats can be found in the Chapter [Preparing your data](../section_prepare_data.md).


![Figure: VizieR catalogue upload page - step FITS images (Screenshot)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cds-astro/a-FAIR-journey-for-astronomical-data/main/episodes/images/vizier_submit_online_interface_july23/step4_fits_images.png){alt="Screenshot: VizieR Catalogue upload page, upload associated data: FITS Images after initiating a session, uploading your tables, filling the ReadMe file and uploading FITS Spectra and Time Series, from June 2023"} 



-------

### Terminate

**This is the last step of your catalogue submission.**

Please, verify that everything is correct before ending your session. Note that you can go back to the current work using the same login until you have submitted this page with the "Yes" button at the end of the page.

**IMPORTANT POINT:** A summary of the files uploaded is available via a temporary link, but **DO NOT USE** this url as it will disappear after publication.

In the last step you can:

- Upload additional files (keeping in mind the accepted formats)
- Add a message to the VizieR staff

Providing an email address is required at that stage. The email will be used if additional information is needed.

**Note:** If a modification to a recently uploaded is needed, please contact the VizieR staff: [cats(at)cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr](mailto:cats@cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr).

<!-- https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/vizier.submit/help.html -->

## Data submission (option 2): File Transfer Protocol 

An other option is to submit your data through File Transfer Protocol. 
This option is particularly recommended if the *ReadMe* file was created using the [**Python cdspyreadme library**][vizier-cdspyreadme] and for large files.

Since October 2021, FTP uploads requires a login authentification.
A web application is available for authors to obtain a temporary login/password:
[https://cds.unistra.fr/ftp/token/][vizier-ftp-login]. It includes some FTP instructions.

VizieR FTP token generation webpage.
Note that it is not an image, you can already generate a temporary login.


-------

### Generate a temporary FTP login

The first step is to register to get a temporary login: available for **3 days**.

To do so, the authors need to provide their email address (e.g. *jane.doe(at)astro.fr*) and choose a login (e.g. *paper\_carbon\_jdoe_jul23*).
This unique FTP login (6 characters at least) will be dedicated for the upload of a single catalogue.

On success, a mail is sent to your email address with the FTP login and some instructions.

-------

### Upload to the CDS repository

Your freshly created account is ready and available for **3** days.
You can put your files directly under the repository  (the root ftp directory being dedicated per login).

More information on the accepted data and formats can be found in the Chapter [Preparing your data](../section_prepare_data.md).

Type the following command in a terminal to access the FTP server: `ftp ftp.cds.unistra.fr`.



``` output
Connected to ftp.cds.unistra.fr.
220 Welcome to the CDS FTP service.

```

#### How to upload a table?

To upload a table (e.g. *table.dat*), use the command: `put table.dat`.

```output
ftp> put table.dat
local: table.dat remote: table.dat
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
```


#### Switching to binary mode
 
In case of Binary data, make sure that your session in in binary mode.
This option, is not set by all FTP client -
To force binary mode, use the command `bin` FTP protocol as follow.


``` output
ftp> bin
200 Switching to Binary mode.
```


#### Passive mode
By accessing the FTP server in *passive mode* -- `ftp -p ftp.cds.unistra.fr` --, one can get the directory listing using `ls`.

```output
ftp> ls
227 Entering Passive Mode (130,79,128,14,36,87).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 115      120          1570 Jul 06 14:08 ReadMe.txt
-rw-r--r--    1 115      120        259200 Jul 06 14:09 spectra_test.fit
-rw-r--r--    1 115      120             0 Jul 06 14:02 table.dat
226 Directory send OK.
```


-------

### Notify the VizieR team

Once you are done uploading your data (*ReadMe*, tables and any other associated data), you need to **SEND AN E-MAIL** to the VizieR team telling them where you have placed files: [cats(at)cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr](mailto:cats@cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr).



<!--  ----------------------------------------- -->
<!--            Summary	                        -->
<!--  ----------------------------------------- -->

## Summary: Data submission

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

2 options for data submission:

- Online interface
- File Transfer Protocol

The CDS provides tools to build *ReadMe* file and aligned ASCII tables (Machine Readable Table in FORTRAN format).

- No need to build it from scratch!

The *ReadMe* file describe your tables by providing all necessary information to locate the catalogue (authors, title, abstract, keywords, acknowledgments, ...).

- This highly standardised file allows reusability and cross matching between catalogues.
- A good description of your data is the key to discoverability.
