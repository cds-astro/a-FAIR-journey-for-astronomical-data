## Overview

The new initiatives for Open Science involve many actors: the journals, archives, the data sharing frameworks, and also the community of authors who publish their data. In this training we highlight the role of the authors, to show how efforts for describing astronomical data in standard ways has an important impact on achieving the goals of Open Science.  

Work within the [ESCAPE][escape] project and the [EOSC Future][eosc-future] project has been aimed at connecting the existing astronomy data publishing systems to the [EOSC][eosc-portal-about]. In this way the familiar processes of publishing data become part of the wider EOSC system. 

In this training we concentrate on the publication of data via the [CDS VizieR service][vizier-home] and show how the process leads to the data being made visible in the [EOSC Portal][eosc-portal], as illustrated in the Figure below. This figure will be built step by step throughout this course.

The journey of your astronomical data (tables and other) starts from a refereed paper (bottom on the left lighthouse). The next step involves making sure your data are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interopable and Reusable), and preparing the associated metadata, before sending your data to VizieR.
[VizieR][vizier-home] is a [CDS][cds-home] service that provides the most complete library of published astronomical catalogues. All the tables and associated data available on VizieR are verified and enriched data, accessible via multiple interfaces, as illustrated by the step 'curation & verification' on the same figure.
Once the data fully available on VizieR, they reach a broader audience with the [International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) registry][ivoa-link] and [B2Find][b2find] (interdisciplinary discovery research data portal from [EUDAT][b2find-about]). The data then propagate to be finally available through [EOSC Portal][eosc-portal], which is an online interface for the EOSC project where people can access research outputs (publications, data, software) but also submit their own data.

## Target audience

<!-- Astronomers who want to publish their data (table, images, spectra, …), and make them available to the community, following the FAIR principles. -->
This training is aimed at researchers in astronomy who want to:

- Make their published data (tables, images, spectra, …) <a href="section_fair_astro.html" target="_blank">Findable, Accessible, Interopable and Reusable (FAIR)</a> and openly accessible to the community. 
- Ensure long-lasting access to their data. 
- Learn about the new developments in Open Science that are being enabled by the EOSC.



## Learning outcomes

By the end of this training, you should be able to:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: checklist

- Outline the benefits of using VizieR **(Chapter 1)**
- Cite the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles **(Chapter 2)**
- Describe the different submission routes per journal **(Chapter 3)**
<!-- - Define the type of data accepted in VizieR  -->
- Prepare your data, integrating the FAIR principles **(Chapter 4)**  
- Submit your data in the existing and new Open Science systems, keeping in mind the Virtual Observatory (VO) standards **(Chapter 5)**
- Summarize all the steps happening behind the curtains once your data are submitted, and before their full integration into the VO **(Chapter 6)** 
- Naviguate through the EOSC portal **(Chapter 7)**
