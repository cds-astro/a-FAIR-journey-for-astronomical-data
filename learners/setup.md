## Overview

The new initiatives for Open Science involve many actors: the journals, archives, the data sharing frameworks, and also the community of authors who publish their data. In this training we highlight the role of the authors, to show how efforts for describing astronomical data in standard ways has an important impact on achieving the goals of Open Science.  

Work within the [ESCAPE][escape] project and the [EOSC Future][eosc-future] project has been aimed at connecting the existing astronomy data publishing systems to the [EOSC][eosc]. In this way the familiar processes of publishing data become part of the wider EOSC system. 

In this training we concentrate on the publication of data via the CDS VizieR service and show how the process leads to the data being made visible in the EOSC Portal. We invite astronomy researchers to follow the journey of their data to EOSC!

## Target audience

<!-- Astronomers who want to publish their data (table, images, spectra, …), and make them available to the community, following the FAIR principles. -->

Researchers in astronomy who want to make their published data (tables, images, spectra, …) <a href="section_fair_astro.html">FAIR</a> and openly accessible to the community. 

This training is also directed at researchers interested in ensuring long-lasting access to their data. 

This training is designed to inform astronomy researchers about the new developments in Open Science that are being enabled by the EOSC.



## Learning outcomes
