## Overview

The new initiatives for Open Science involve many actors: the journals, archives, the data sharing frameworks, and also the community of authors who publish their data. In this training we highlight the role of the authors, to show how efforts for describing astronomical data in standard ways has an important impact on realising the goals of Open Science.  


## Audience

Astronomers who want to publish their data (table, images, spectra, …), and make them available to the community, following the FAIR principles. 
This training is also directed at researchers interested in ensuring long-lasting access to their data.
