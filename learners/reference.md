UCD
: Unified Content Descriptor 

Formal vocabulary for astronomical data that is controlled by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). 
A UCD does not define the units nor the name of a quantity, but rather "what sort of quantity is this?"; for example phys.temperature represents a temperature, without implying a particular unit.
